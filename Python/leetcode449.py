# Serialize and Deserialize BST

# ???

# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
#
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
#
# The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
#
# Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
